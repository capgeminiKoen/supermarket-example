## Supermarket assignment

This is an example of how to make the supermarket assignment.

See the following youtube video for the entire explanation:

The assignment is as follows:

```
Supermarket

Design & build a supermarket implementation according to the concepts that you have learned about OO.
Don't forget to pay attention to code quality such as documentation, comments and tests.

The supermarket should at least support the following things (not - I repeat: NOT necessarily with user input! start without it at first):

- Add and remove products from the shopping cart
- Checkout at the cash register
- Cash register should be able to calculate the change and show it 
- Cash register should be able to calculate the total discount and show it 
	+ (you get a 0,50 euros discount if your order is more than 10 euros, and 1 euro discount if you order for more than 20 euros).

The supermarket should contain the following products (at least):
- Soap, 3 euros
- Cereals, 2,50 euros
- Chinese vegetables, 5 euros
- Yoghourt, 2 euros
- Diapers, 10 euros

END RESULT:
zipped code / git repo of a Java application which demo's a supermarket.
Your Main class should contain a method which takes care of this.

When you are done with this functionality, you are free to "take it away". Impress us :)

Tips:
- Start with thinking about OO!
- Don't overcomplicate things, start at the beginning and try to make something small that actually works
- Don't solve all the problems at once, start with the first goal
- If you want to work with euros, it might be nice to think about them in terms of cents, since that allows you to use an int, which is much simpler than a double or a float.

BONUS CORNER (not in logical order):
- Use git all the way through (with PR's, that you yourself complete)
    + commit often is a huge plus
- Unit tests
- Read products from file
- Go for the interactive supermarket - order products and pay with console input.
- ASCII art on startup
